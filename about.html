      <h1>How did he get started?</h1>
      <p>
        Eminem, byname of Marshall Bruce Mathers III, (born October 17, 1972,
        St. Joseph, Missouri, U.S.), American rapper, record producer, and actor
        who was known as one of the most controversial and best selling artists
        of the early 21st century. Mathers had a turbulent childhood, marked by
        poverty and allegations of abuse. At age 14 he began rapping in clubs in
        Detroit, Michigan, and, when unexcused absences kept him in the ninth
        grade for the third year, he quit school, determined to make it in
        hip-hop music. As Eminem, he made a name for himself in the hip-hop
        underground, both as a solo artist and as a member of the Detroit-based
        rap sextet D12 (also known as the Dirty Dozen). His first album,
        Infinite (1996), sold poorly, however, and he continued to work menial
        jobs.

        When Eminem placed second in the freestyle category at the 1997 Rap
        Olympics in Los Angeles, he came to the attention of Dr. Dre, founding
        member of pioneering rappers N.W.A. and the head of Aftermath
        Entertainment. By that time Eminem had developed the persona of the
        inhibitionless Slim Shady, who gave voice to Eminem’s id in often vulgar
        and violent lyrics. With Dr. Dre as his producer and mentor, Eminem
        released The Slim Shady LP early in 1999. Benefiting from the inventive
        channel-surfing music video for the hit song “My Name Is” and the
        instant credibility of Dr. Dre’s involvement, the album sold several
        million copies, and Eminem won two Grammy Awards and four MTV Video
        Music Awards.
